arduinoLightAnimation
=====================

CSS3 style color animation for controlling RGB leds on Arduino

Note: Putting "delay" function will interfere with the timing of the animation, since the update function is supposed to be executed each cycle. 

Features

- Order for setting animation keyframe is not relevant
- Transition when animation are changed on runtime 
- Can put colors in rgb, hex, hsb


css3 animation comparison


- animation-duration 
	CSS3: Specifies how many seconds or milliseconds an animation takes to complete one cycle. Default 0. 
	aLA: Specifies how many milliseconds an animation takes to complete one cycle. Default 1000ms. 
		can be set either when the animation is set: 
			myAnimator.setAnimation(animationKeyFrameArray, nKeyFrames, duration_ms); 
		or BEFORE to set the animation: 
			myAnimator.setDuration(duration_ms);
			myAnimator.setAnimation(animationKeyFrameArray, nKeyFrames); 

- animation-timing-function
	CSS3: Describes how the animation will progress over one cycle of its duration. Default "ease"
	aLA: Now only linear

- animation-delay
	CSS3: Specifies when the animation will start. Default 0
	aLA: Start to update after a delay will suffice. 

- animation-iteration-count
	CSS3: Specifies the number of times an animation is played. Default 1
	aLA: Specifies the number of times an animation is played. Default infinite; 
		in setup, for setting number of iterations
			myAnimator.setIterations(nIterations); 
		for setting infinite iterations 
			myAnimator.setIterationsInfinite(true); 
		or restore past number of iterations
			myAnimator.setIterationsInfinite(false); 

		


- animation-direction
	CSS3: Specifies whether or not the animation should play in reverse on alternate cycles. Default "normal" 
		http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-direction.asp
	aLA: Specifies if the animation is played always from begin to end "normal" or alternately from begin to end, then from end to begin "alternate". Default is "normal". 
		in setup, for setting the "alternate" mode. 
			myAnimator.setAlternate(true); 
		"normal" mode
			myAnimator.setAlternate(false); 
		
		
- animation-play-state
	CSS3: Specifies whether the animation is running or paused. Default "running"
	aLA: Not updating works as a pause. 	


Other features
- Set time of trasition between different animations
		myAnimator.setTransitionDuration(unsigned long _transitionDuration)
